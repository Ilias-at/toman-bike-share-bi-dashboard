# 🚴 Toman Bike Share: Strategic Business Intelligence Dashboard

## Project Summary

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analytics and Business Intelligence (BI) skills by transforming raw bike-share data into a strategic Power BI dashboard. The analysis delivers actionable insights used to optimize pricing, enhance operational focus, and maximize profitability.

## 🎯 The Business Challenge (Situation & Task)

### Situation : 
The Toman Bike Share executive team needed a comprehensive, centralized view of key business metrics to shift from reactive decisions to **data-driven strategic planning.** They lacked clear insight into rider behavior, seasonal trends, and the profitability impact of historical pricing.

### Task :
1.  Defining clear **Business (BRD) and Functional (FRD) Requirements** using an **Agile/Scrum** methodology.
2.  Developing the data pipeline (SQL) and the analytical model (Power BI).
3.  Delivering a dynamic dashboard that provides **actionable pricing and marketing recommendations.**

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation & Methodology (Action)

### 1. Data Preparation and Modeling (SQL & Excel)
* **Data Aggregation:** Used **SQL** (`UNION ALL`) to combine data from two separate years (`bike_share_yr_0`, `bike_share_yr_1`).
* **Financial Metric Calculation:** Applied a `LEFT JOIN` to integrate cost data and calculated crucial metrics: **Revenue** and **Profit** (`riders*price - cogs*riders`).
* **Tool:** The resulting dataset was prepared for visualization.

### 2. Business Intelligence & Visualization (Power BI)
* **Dashboard Development:** Designed a **centralized, interactive dashboard** consolidating trends across time (hourly, weekly, seasonal) and user demographics.

### 3. Strategic Analysis
The model was used to identify high-leverage insights, specifically:
* **Peak Demand:** Identified peak earnings hours (10 AM to 3 PM) and highest-profit days (Wednesday and Friday).
* **Demographics:** Confirmed that **81.17% of riders are registered users**, informing loyalty strategy.

## 📈 Value & Strategic Results (Result)

### Key Insights & Recommendations

| Insight Generated by Data | Strategic Recommendation (Business Value) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Seasonal Peak:** Summer (Season 3) generates the highest revenue ($4.9M), while Winter (Season 1) is the lowest ($2.2M). | Implement higher **Seasonal Pricing** during Summer months; offer promotions in Winter to maintain engagement. |
| **Hourly Profit:** Peak earnings occur from **10 AM to 3 PM**. | Focus operational/marketing efforts and introduce a slight **Peak Hour Price Increase** (e.g., 10–15%) to test demand elasticity. |
| **Rider Loyalty:** 81.17% of the user base are registered subscribers. | Develop **Loyalty Programs and Retention Incentives** focused on the registered user segment to secure long-term recurring revenue. |

### Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases the ability to apply **Agile** processes, translate **BRD/FRD** into a technical solution, and drive **data-backed decision-making** that directly impacts a company's profitability.
